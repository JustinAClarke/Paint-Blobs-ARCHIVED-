# Paint Blobs (ARCHIVED)

### History:
Year 10 IT, we were required to create a 'program' with our learned skills,
and if we wanted we could enter it into the Monash Uni IT competition that year.

As Desctiption.doc says:

NOTE: I have no idea where the name 'Frotz' came from.
```
Frotz paint blobs was made with visual basic 6.0, I have used 14 forms in the program. I have created the program to educate children about colours. I have used a variety of colours and shapes for the user to find the correct colour. I have used a verity of forms as levels and also screen shots.

I did try to make a high score form but that unfortunately didn’t work I was not able to get the correct coding to make the high scores work. I got the images off the web then changed the colours to what I wanted. I then made the forms according to how hard I wanted them; I have tried to make the colours to be as evenly spread out through all of the levels.

I have chosen contrasting colours; one because I am colour blind to an extent, but also to make it easer for the user of the game to pick the colours because they are so different. The game was originally created for an IT project but I have changed some things for this competition. The game is simple in the context that the aim of the game is to click the correct coloured paint blob, if you click on the incorrect blob then it will come up with and error saying “Sorry but that is not a ..... paint blob, that is a …… paint blob”. The coding was easy to complete the program, except I was not able to get the high score form working so I have taken it out.
```

I did end up entering this into the IT competition and managed to win 2nd place.


### Building / Installing

This was originally created with Mcrosoft Visual Basic 6.0.

I have no idea if you are still able get a copy of VB6, or if you have an existing version, install it.

This repo is just for archival purposes for me to see how far I have come, or haven't.


### Copyright

As this was originally created for educational purposes and I have no idea what copyright was,

All 'paint blob' images even though edited remain property of their original owners ( whoever they might be, google images).
